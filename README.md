# Comprehensive-Analysis-of-EPL-Match-Data
--

Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of English Premier League (EPL) match data to uncover meaningful insights about team performances, player statistics, and match outcomes.
The goal was to prepare the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and apply machine learning techniques to predict match results.

Key objectives included:
	•	Cleaning and preprocessing EPL match datasets.
	•	Performing in-depth statistical analysis and visualization of match trends (e.g., goals scored, wins, losses, draws).
	•	Building machine learning models to predict match outcomes (Win, Draw, Loss) based on pre-match features.
	•	Evaluating models based on standard metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

The project is structured inside a Jupyter Notebook (EPL Project Final.ipynb), with each step clearly outlined and visualized.

Techniques and Tools Used
	•	Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering (e.g., form calculation, recent performance stats).
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
	•	Feature Selection: Identifying important predictors impacting match outcomes.
	•	Machine Learning Models:
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Random Forest Classifier
	•	XGBoost Classifier
	•	Model Evaluation: Confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves.
